    <p>Red rectangle represents sheet of map. You can drag it along the map.</p>
    <p>You can change other parameters of rectangle using panel in left-bottom corner:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select "Portrait" or "Landscape" to change printed page orientation</li>
        <li>You can select one of size presets or manually define horizontal and vertical size of sheet</li>
        <li>Choose scale of map in rendered sheet</li>
        <li>"Resolution" listbox defines number of pixels in rendered map. Bigger level corresponds to more bigger number of pixels</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>User tracks can be shown on the map using track upload control at the top of a screen. 
       Upload them using URL or by local file uploading. Note, that tracks woun't be rendered on map sheets! 
       They are just shown on the screen to help sheet positioning.</p>
    
    <p>Press <b>"+"</b> button in the top right corner of the screen to toggle and reorder map layers. 
       Note, that only "Arbalet" and "Slazav" layers will be used for rendering.</p>
    
    <p>When you place your sheet in right place on map and choose required parameters, press "Render Sheet" button.
       Note, that there is limitation of maximum number of pixels in rendered map (12M pixels). 
       Be patient - rendering can be a long process! 
       Few seconds (or minutes :) later three web links to PNG image, OziExplorer MAP and Google KMZ files will appear below the button.
    </p>
